The rows can also be sorted on the basis of total bytes exchanged to identify the **Top Talkers**. Also, the IP addresses do not provide much information, as it is not exactly a human readable format. Network Name Resolution feature can be utilised to perform reverse DNS queries to obtain names for the IP address.
