# Packet-Analysis-using-Wireshark

## Introduction
Wireshark is a packet-sniffing application. It is GUI-based. Wireshark is opensource software and supports all major operating systems- Windows, Mac OS X and Linux-based platforms. 
The normal traffic on the network has to be analysed to be able to recognise if there is a problem in traffic flow. For example: If one has to solve problems related to working of DHCP, then they need to know ehat the DHCP working traffic is like on a network.   

On occasions, Wireshark may not be able to keep up with a busy link. It is a GUI tool and calls dumpcap, which is a command line tool. Dumpcap captures the packets and stores them as a disk file, while Wireshark reads and presents them. There are various high performance capture appliance offered which can be used as an alternative.

## Install Wireshark
The demonstration has been performed on a Linux environment- Ubuntu 20.04.2.0 virtual machine running on VMWare Fusion for Mac OS. The setup for the environment of operating system has not been detailed.

Wireshark has been [setup on the machine](installation_wireshark.md) and the interface ens33 is [identified as the interface](identify_interface.md) on which we capture packets.

## Conversations
Sometimes we need identify the specific packets. This can be done by identifying the IP addresses of the source and destination. Even the conversation between specific nodes can also be filtered out. [Conversation](conversations_wireshark.md) can be accessed from the Statistics menu.

## Capture Location
The [selection of location](location_wireshark.md) to capture packets for analysis depends on:
* Issue being investigated
* Usefulness of the packets captured depending upon the ability to capture packets
* Technical obstacles faced during capture

## Filters
### Capture Filters
Capture filters are used to reduce the amount of traffic saved during a packet capture. 
In practice, capture filters should be used sparingly, if used at all, to help make sure 
that no packets that are important for an analysis are inadvertently missed because they 
fall outside the capture filter parameters. Remember that you can always filter out unwanted
traffic from a capture, but you can't do anything about missed packets once the capture is finished. 
If you're unsure about a capture, perform the capture again with a more generous capture filter or none at all.

One scenario where a capture filter is appropriate is when you want to let a capture run for a long 
period of time. Then, you should filter out as much extraneous traffic as possible to keep capture
file sizes under control. However, take care to make sure the capture filter you apply doesn't exclude 
any traffic that may be useful for the analysis.
It's usually a good idea to do some trial captures when using capture filters to verify that the filter 
is working as desired before doing the official capture that you want to keep.

## Protocols

### ICMP
The [Internet Control Message Protocol](icmp.md) (ICMP) is used to send error messages indicating that a requested service is not available, or if device could not be reached. It is a control protocol. Although it is transported as IP datagrams, it does not carry the application data. Instead, it carries the information about the status of the network itself.

### Internet Protocol Version 6
The [Internet Protocol Version 6](ipv6.md) (IPv6) is the latest version of Internet protocol, and although it is in its earliest stages of adoption, it is intended to eventually replace IPv4—mostly to alleviate the shortage of IP addresses that can be assigned to network devices. IPv4, with its 32-bit address space, provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses, nearly all of which have been assigned to companies and private interests worldwide.

### UDP
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is considered an unreliable transport. In this, there's no guarantee of packet delivery or ordering, but it has a lower overhead and is used by time-sensitive applications such as voice and video traffic.

The UDP header is only 8-bytes long, consisting of:
• Source and Destination port number: This is 2 bytes each.
• Length: This is the length of the UDP header plus the payload. This is a 2-byte field.
• Checksum: This is a 2-byte field used to check for errors in the UDP header and data. If no checksum was generated by the transmitter, this will be all zeroes.

### TCP
The [Transmission Control Protocol](tcp.md) (TCP) provides a reliable delivery of data by detecting lost, duplicated, or out-of-order packets, requesting retransmission of lost data, or rearranging packets in the right order before delivering them to the application. TCP can also accept a large chunk of data from an application and handle getting the data transported to the other end reliably using multiple packets and reassembling them at the other end.
