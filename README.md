# Packet-Analysis-using-Wireshark

## Introduction
Wireshark is a packet-sniffing application. It is GUI-based. Wireshark is opensource software and supports all major operating systems- Windows, Mac OS X and Linux-based platforms. 
The normal traffic on the network has to be analysed to be able to recognise if there is a problem in traffic flow. For example: If one has to solve problems related to working of DHCP, then they need to know ehat the DHCP working traffic is like on a network.
There would be 3 panes displayed- packet list, packet details and packet bytes. Even the preferences can be set:

1. User Interface: Data presentation on Wireshark
2. Capture: The interface where the packets are captured, promiscuous mode, etc.
3. Printing: Format for printing data
4. Name Resolution: Resolution of addresses to readable form
5. Statistics: Configurable options
6. Protocols: Capture and display specific packets
